To run the Perceptron, Adaline and SGD classifier:
1. python main.py Perceptron 'iris.csv'
2. python main.py Adaline 'iris.csv'
3. python main.py SGD 'iris.csv'

This prints the error values, accuracy and plots figure for errors in each iteration for the given binary classifier.

I have only used the iris dataset. I have used datasets iris.csv for training and test.csv for testing.

For the multiclass classifier, I have just written the concept in program. It cannot be called from the main function.
to run the onevsrest.py
1. python onevsrest.py
